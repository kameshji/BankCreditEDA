When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

  1. the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
  2. if the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

This case study aims to identify patterns that indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
 
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind the loan default, i.e. the variables which are string indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
